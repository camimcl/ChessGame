# ChessGame
This repo is intended for a chessGame in Java, i used oop fundamentals to build this during my Java course on Udemy.
These concepts were used to create a functional chess structure that can still be expanded and refined.
Using OOP in this project makes the code more modular and scalable, making it easy for future improvements, such as the inclusion of new rules or a graphical interface.
This project is a great example of how fundamental programming concepts can be applied in a practical contextâ€‹
here I only used Java to develop this small skeleton of the game, it's working, but I still plan to improve it.

## Objective 
train my fundamentals in object orientation and the core of java.

## Fundamentals  
  ### Here's how i used the fundamentals 
- **Polymorphism and inheritance**\
allow parts to share common characteristics and implement their specific behaviors.


- **Data Structures**\
The board is a matrix that facilitates the organization of positions and control of pieces.


- **Exceptions**\
Ensure that invalid movements are handled safely, preventing execution errors.

  
- **Static members**\
Used to maintain functionalities or variables that are shared between all instances, such as general game rules.


- **Downcasting**\
used to convert object references from the ChessPiece class to their specific subclasses (such as Pawn or King), allowing access to methods or attributes unique to those subclasses.


- **Enums**\
Used to define the types of parts and colors, ensuring greater clarity and organization of the code.


- **Overriding**\
Individual pieces (like Rook and Pawn) override methods from the ChessPiece class to define their specific moves.


- **Layers pattern**\
The game is divided into different layers, such as the logic layer, to define the rules for moving the pieces, and the presentation layer
